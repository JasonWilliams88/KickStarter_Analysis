### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
- Formatting the nested if functions was an issue. Using google searches I was able to get it down.




## Results
### Based on the Outcomes vs Launch Date
- December will be the best time to release a theater performance 
- The success rate is higher than the failure rate other than at one time point when all years are averaged 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
- Settling a lower financial goal was indicative of a higher success rate in respect to plays


### Limitations and Future Analysis
- Outcome vs Goals was not weight against total projects allowing for outliers to cloudy the analysis for the larger goal ranges
- Include a variance graph to cathc outliers and give more confidence in the findings
